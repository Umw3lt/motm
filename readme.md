Perhaps the most illuminating and extraordinary book about the human mind ever made (in modern times) was published in 1981: Charles Hampden-Turner's **Maps of the Mind**.

60 maps, each combining text and a 'map' that is both a schematic and a work of art, represent a survey of theories of the mind in the west. 

This is a project to convert this book into:

- data models predicated on personal data, usable over personal data vaults, such as [Solid](https://solidproject.org) 
- 3D models, usable in data visualisation, VR, and AR
